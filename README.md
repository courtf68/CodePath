## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I did not use any outside resources to help complete my submission.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
    One challenge I encountered in creating this submission was working with Glitch. 
At first I was adjusting well, as I have worked with similiar software like Replit, but then when I tried to run the program it wouldn't work. 
To troubleshoot this I changed the names of my button ids as I had made them different than what was said in the instructions. 
I know that names of ids are not an issue unless they dont match up in every file and usage but just in case I changed them to their given names.
This change made my preview stop loading and I couldn't do anything. I changed the names back to what I had oringally but the page still wouldn't appear. 
I asked for help in the Slack and I was told that the code I had worked so I just stepped away from the program for a while and when I came back the preview was working! I believe it was a glitch on Glitch.
However, once I completed the code from there, I still had a problem. The pattern would play correctly but when I would copy it, I would lose the game occasionally for what it seemed like no reason.
I tried to debug this by printing statements to the console and inspecting what was happening. Despite this, I still couldn't figure out the problem so I made a new file and re-did the project very carefully and got it to work!



3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Some questions about web development I have after completing my submission are why javascript and css styling can be used both in html and in their own seperate files. I believe it is because of personal choice and convenience but I am 
curious about if there was ever just one way to do it. Another question I have is why was javascript created for web design. I wonder if java was ever used for web design or could be used like that.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had a few more hours to work on this project I would make the pattern switch every time. I was trying to implement that but I got stuck with making sure the length was still the same and kept losing for some reason. I would also change the shape of the buttons to be circular and decorate them more to include more colors within each button.
Another feature I would add are levels where the buttons could switch colors or places so that each time difficulty increased and the pattern was shown quicker.
